                <p>The goal was to be able to create custom style sheets and allow for the coloring of icons for <a
                        href="https://sosuke.com/creating-a-dovetail-agent-theme/" target="_blank">Creating a Dovetail
                        Agent
                        Theme</a>.</p>
                <p>For this code to work well the starting color needs to be black. If your icon set isn't black you can
                    prepend "brightness(0) saturate(100%)" to your filter property which will first turn the icon set to
                    black.</p>
                <p>
                    For as long as I worked on creating this solution from multiple resources I found some had spent far
                    longer to create this already completed solution. Only slightly modified to focus on HEX colors.
